        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The average Canadian consumer throws out a quarter of the food they buy, which totals to around 170kg of food waste each year. However, the problem of food waste is not limited to consumers. In fact, 35.5 million tonnes of all food produced in Canada is thrown out, and grocers are responsible for more than 20% of this food waste. These are just some of the astounding facts I learned during my time at Flashfood. <br>‍<br>Flashfood aims to reduce food waste at the consumer level and to provide affordable food for families. Flashfood sells surplus food at a discounted price, and customers can purchase these items through the app. Flashfood.com is the marketing website for Flashfood Inc. It focuses on promoting the app and delivering Flashfood’s story. <br></p>

        <h2>Role</h2>
        <p>I was the front end developer for Flashfood.com, where I worked with 2 marketers and 3 designers. My role was the build new pages and to automate the process of updating content for our current pages. By the end of my four months at Flashfood, I wanted to ensure that our 2 marketers could update the website without having to write code.<br></p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-section">
        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>First, I conducted an audit of the current website. I noted down any problems that I noticed. These problems included the pain points of both our marketers and our users. <br></p><img src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/plugins/Image/assets/placeholder.60f9b1840c.svg" alt="" class="rect-img">
        <p>I will be focusing on the following two problems in this case study. <br>1. Updating content is slow<br>2. Long page load times<br></p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-section">
        <h2>Problem 1: Updating Content is Slow</h2>
        <p>I conducted an audit of all webpages on Flashfood.com and identifed pages that require frequent updates such as: blog, news, locations, team. I identified trends and patterns these pages held and researched ways to automate content. Currently, it takes person 10 minutes to upload/modify one item because the process requires duplicating HTML elements, styling etc. This number quickly adds up, as locations can be added in batches up to 80 at a time. I automated this process by storing all our items in a content management system and creating a universal style sheet. The webpage would pull items from the content management system and style these items from the style sheet. <br>‍<br>Rather than spending hours editing the content on a webpage, our marketers can directly update content in the content management system and the webpage will populate itself accordingly. The entire process now only takes 5 minutes, and requires no coding knowledge whatsoever. <br></p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-section">
        <h2>Problem 2: Shortening Page Load Times</h2>
        <p>Currently it takes our blog page 6 seconds and up to 20 seconds at times to load. The common problems were: large image files, CORS (cross-origin resource sharing). I researched ways to solve these problems, coming across solutions such as compressing files, prefetch, and pagination.<br>‍<br>I started by converting all the high quality pngs that were 1.7MB in size down to 300kb which resulted in a 2.3s decrease in load times.<br>‍<br>However, with considerations of more articles being posted in the future, we needed a long term solution. Based on my research, pagination and lazy load were the top choices. I spoke with the team to explore the tradeoffs:<br></p>
        <div class="horizontal-flex">
          <div class="two-col"></div>
          <div class="two-col"></div>
        </div>
        <p>We decided that lazy load was the best solution for us. After lazy load was implemented, the blog page now loads in 3 seconds.<br></p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-section">
        <h2>Learnings and Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Now that the process of updating content is automated, our marketers are able to place their time and resources into other objectives for the company. <br>‍<br>In the future, it would be nice to implement more than one style for blog posts and news articles, since they all follow the exact same format. A little variation will make the content more interesting and engaging for frequent readers, which could potentially boost our retention rates. <br>‍<br>In regards to optimizing page load times, although I was able to half the load time, 3 seconds is far from ideal. In order to further improve the website, changes can be made to ensure the most meaningful content is loaded first. That way, the user will have a webpage view to interact with while the rest of the page loads. <br>‍<br>These two projects show how important it is to keep re-evaluating what has already been completed. There is always a better solution and continuous improvement is what drives a company forward. <br></p>
